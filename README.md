# TailwindCSS Config

This repository serves as a base config for all of the websites I make using TailwindCSS. I have made this to keep all custom colour/utility variants in one central place. :smile:

## A Fresh TailwindCSS Setup

These instructions are for when TailwindCSS has already been installed and set up. If you want to get started with TailwindCSS you can follow the instructions [here](#https://tailwindcss.com/).

You can tweak this config to your liking and to fit better with your design theme. All you need to do is follow the instructions on the [TailwindCSS](#https://tailwindcss.com/) website.

Enjoy using this config!
